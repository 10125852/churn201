## Employee Churn 201: Calculating Employee Value

Welcome to the GitHub outpost of the recent Predictive Analytics Times articles by Pasha Roberts from [Talent Analytics][ta]:

- [Churn 201][churn201]: Calculating Employee Value
- [Churn 202][churn202]: Good and Bad Churn

Our goal here is to foster conversation and learning, including learning by us.

Stand by as we make some quick updates to the site following the publication of our second article. Until then:

### Using R

To use this code, either download the single `blog001.R` file, or use the `Download ZIP` button, or best of all, use git to clone the project.
Running the code is easy, if you are familiar with R:

- Open R, R Studio, or whatever R platform you use.
- Set the working directory to your downloaded/cloned directory
- `source(blog201.R)` to run the numbers, based on the hardcoded values.
- Display the graph by printing `fig1`
- To change assumptions, edit the program and repeat.

This is designed to be short and simple, so there are no fancy sliders or D3 visualizations... yet.
As new blog articles come out, we will publish additional code to support the new ideas.

### Submitting Updates

We do encourage experimentation, and you are welcome to present useful ["pull requests"][pullreq] or ["issues"][issues] to this project to make it better.
